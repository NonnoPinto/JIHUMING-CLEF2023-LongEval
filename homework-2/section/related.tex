There are many search engines, using different techniques to enhance retrieval effectiveness, from which we have taken
inspiration from.
The BM25 similarity function is widely used information retrieval as it considers term frequencies and document length.
This function has demonstrated effectiveness in balancing precision and recall in search results~\cite{BM25}, even if it
doesn't consider meta-data document information as other approaches~\cite{robertson2009probabilistic} do.\\

The tokenization technique we have employed, whitespace tokenization, has not been the primary focus of research in any
study.
Anyway, it seems to provide a useful baseline for tokenization as some studies~\cite{gowsmith2022improving} suggest that
allowing tokens to include spaces produces problem, especially when working with transformers.
