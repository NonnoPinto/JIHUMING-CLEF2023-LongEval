Our group will propose an original and efficient information retrieval
  system for Longitudinal Evaluation of Model Performance (LongEval)
  by CLEF2023\cite{LongEval}. Focus is on short term and long term
  temporal persistence of the systemsâ€™ performance,
  for both English and French documents. The aim is to find a model giving
  good results for longitudinal evolving benchmarks,
  for the subject Search Engines, University of Padova.
