\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:setup}

Our work was initiated based on the experimental setups outlined below.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Evaluation measures: MAP (Mean Average Precision) and NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) scores
	\item \citep[Repository]{jihuming}
	\item During the development and the experimentation, personal computers were used
	\item Java JDK version 17, Apache version 2, Lucene version 9.5, Maven
\end{itemize}
Our team has created several indexes from the collection which was provided by LongEval. Indexes were created to be used in experiments with the runs, and they were created in order to enable fast and effective search and retrieval. 
All of the created indexes are multilingual. Which gives the ability to use, understand, communicate in more than one language since we have two languages in our project to work with.  In other words they are proficient in multiple languages. 
Additionally indexes were created with different implementations of character 3-grams,  character 4-grams and character 5-grams in order to capture different aspects of the language. Indexes which implementation of character 3-grams are based on groups of three consecutive characters in each document allowing for some contextual understanding of word variations and misspellings. 4-gram indexes capture four consecutive characters and additional information about word and phrase structure. They were used to provide even greater context around words and to improve query performance and precision. 5-gram indexes, which use groups of five consecutive characters were used to capture even more context around words to aim further improvements in query performance. 
Additional functionality of some of the indexes is having query expansion with synonyms, which provides the improvement of the search results by including related words or phrases that are equivalent in meaning to the user's original query. 
One index(2023\_05\_05\_multilingual\_4gram\_synonym\_ner) uses Named Entity Recognition which provides not only the search for keywords but also identifying and extracting specific named entities. By implementing this to the index, the accuracy and relevance is improved.
The subsequent indexes are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 2023\_04\_24\_multilingual\_3gram
	\item 2023\_04\_29\_multilingual\_3gram\_synonym
	\item 2023\_05\_01\_multilingual\_4gram\_synonym
	\item 2023\_05\_01\_multilingual\_5gram\_synonym
	\item 2023\_05\_05\_multilingual\_4gram\_synonym\_ner
\end{itemize}
The indexes also can be found in the following Google Drive \href{https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CK_kLeZ5Us3VJe8hiG1vhwPrDs94cLvU?usp=share_link}{folder}.
