\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}


This report aims at providing a brief explanation of the Information Retrieval system built
as a team project during the Search Engine course 22/23 of the masterâ€™s degree in Computer
Engineering and Data Science at University of Padua, Italy.
Task chosen by the group is CLEF LongEval: Longitudinal Evaluation of Model Performance.\\
Longeval Websearch collection\cite{traindata} relies on a large set of data provided by a commercial Qwant
(a commercial search engine). The idea is to reflect changes of the Web across time,
providing evolving document and query sets.\\
Our approach uses on N-grams, trying to avoid the problem of the sparsity of the data.
Our focus was not to produce a high scoring specialized system, but to try
developing general ideas in order to approach sentences selection and query expansion.\\
