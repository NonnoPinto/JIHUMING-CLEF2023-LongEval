\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In summary, the IR systems developed in this study followed the Parsing-Analyzer-Index-Search-Topic paradigm and utilized different methodologies: English Analyzer and Index, French Analyzer and Index, 
concatenated N-grams Analyzer and Index of both versions, and NER information extraction using NLP techniques. \\
The evaluation of the 12 developed systems was based on their effectiveness in generating runs on the training data comprising French and translated English queries and documents, which were then scored by trec\_eval using MAP and NCDG scores. Among these systems, five models performed the best, namely fr\_fr\_5gram, fr\_fr\_4gram, fr\_fr\_3gram, fr\_en\_fr\_5gram, and fr\_fr\_4gram\_ner, listed in order of their scores from highest to lowest for both MAP and NCDG.\\
In terms of future work, there are several areas that could be explored to improve the effectiveness of the developed IR systems. Firstly, we could improve indexing methodologies, such as increasing the value of N of N-gram, to further enhance the performance of the IR systems. 
Secondly,  we could explore better use of NLP techniques to improve the accuracy of the IR systems. \\
